BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

NOTE: You need to use a recent version of Scala (at least 2.10.2) to compile ECALogic. Your Linux distribution may ship with an older version, so beware of this. When using sbt, it solves this problem for you by installing the correct version of Scala in a local folder.

There are various ways to deploy this project to your users:

==================
1) Create a "fat .jar" 

When using plain old "sbt package", a .jar file is created that does not contain the Scala library, forcing users to install the correct version of Scala (2.10.2 or better) to run it. It is not a good way to distribute the project to your users. Instead, use sbt to create a proguarded .jar as follows:

// TODO EDIT ME
> whatever:wheeeee "proguard" MAKEJAR --fat

The .jar file created will be quite large, since it contains large parts of the Scala default library.

==================
2) Creating a sbt-launch application.

This creates a small .zip file (in target/) with a portable script/batch file that you can distribute to your users. On first execution, this downloads the relevant libraries and our application from a Maven repository.

To create, from within sbt, use:

> launcher:package

In case ECALogic is not available through the public Maven repository, you need to publish it to a local repository as well:

> publishLocal

The advantage of this is that users will always have a recent version; the disadvantage is a slightly slower startup time of the program.
